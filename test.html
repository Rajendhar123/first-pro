        Mindfulness, the practice of being fully present and engaged in the moment, has gained popularity in recent years for its numerous benefits. By focusing on the present rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, individuals can cultivate a greater sense of calm and clarity. Studies have shown that mindfulness can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. It encourages self-awareness and emotional regulation, helping people respond to situations thoughtfully rather than react impulsively.
